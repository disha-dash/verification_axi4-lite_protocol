# Verification of AXI4-Lite Protocol

This project verifies an **AXI4-Lite slave interface** using a **SystemVerilog layered testbench**.  
The testbench master drives read and write transactions and checks **protocol compliance and data integrity** through monitoring and scoreboard verification.

# What is AXI4-Lite

AXI4-Lite is a simplified version of the AXI bus protocol used for **low-bandwidth memory-mapped communication** between processors and peripherals.

It supports **single read and write transactions** using a **VALID–READY handshake mechanism** across five independent channels.

---

# Five Channels of AXI4-Lite

## Write Address Channel (AW)
Carries the **address of the write operation**.

## Write Data Channel (W)
Carries the **data to be written**.

## Write Response Channel (B)
The slave sends the **status of the write transaction**.

## Read Address Channel (AR)
Carries the **address of the read operation**.

## Read Data Channel (R)
Carries the **data returned from the slave**.

---

# VALID–READY Handshake

AXI uses a **two-signal handshake mechanism** that ensures safe data transfer without data loss.

A transaction occurs when **both VALID and READY signals are high (1).**

## AXI4-Lite Handshake Signals

### Master Signals (Master → Slave)

- `AWVALID` – Indicates the write address on the AW channel is valid  
- `WVALID` – Indicates the write data on the W channel is valid  
- `BREADY` – Master is ready to accept the write response  
- `ARVALID` – Indicates the read address on the AR channel is valid  
- `RREADY` – Master is ready to accept the read data  

### Slave Signals (Slave → Master)

- `AWREADY` – Slave is ready to accept the write address  
- `WREADY` – Slave is ready to accept the write data  
- `BVALID` – Write response from the slave is valid  
- `ARREADY` – Slave is ready to accept the read address  
- `RVALID` – Read data from the slave is valid
